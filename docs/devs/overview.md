# Developer Overview

As a developer, you can utilize Band Protocol's public datasets to power your decentralized applications. In this section, we dive into the details of how you can connect your smart contracts with Band Protocol's smart contracts and start querying for data, such as financial data points or sport results, on-chain as a simple function call.

Developers can start developing with Band Protocol right now on [Kovan testnet](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/) network. Ethereum mainnet launch is coming soon! Let's continue on to the next section to see what's like to query with Band Protocol [ðŸ‘‰](/devs/connect-with-band.md)

## Warning: Ether Is Required

Through [Token-Curated DataSources](../band/tcd.md), dataset token holders collectively elect a set of trusted data providers, who are eligible to work to supply data. These providiers

### What If Data Is Not Available?

While data providers are work

As explained in [Protocol Architecture](/band/overview.md), Band Protocol's Token-Curated DataSources allows

## Prerequisite

To connect with Band Protocol, your smart contracts need to be funded with **ETH** to be sent when invoking the oracle's `query` function. Here's a
