## Key-Value Format

Similar to other datasets on Band Protocol, data consumers query for financial data by providing an _input key_ in return for an _output value_. We cover the specification in this subsection.

### Input Key

An input key consists of two parts, concatnated with `/` as the delimiter.

- The first part, [Query Type](#supported-query-types), is a unique identifier that identifies query type.
- The second part is a variable length parameter as required from corresponding query type.

Examples are provided as follows.

| Key (hex)                      | Key (ascii)      | Explanation                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `53504f5450582f4642`           | `SPOTPX/FB`      | Spot price of Facebook stock |
| `53504f5450582f4554482d555344` | `SPOTPX/ETH-USD` | Spot price of ETH/USD pair   |

### Output Value

An output value is a 256-bit unsigned integer that represents the output result. Depending on query type, output value may be multiplied by 10<sup>18</sup> to maintain arithmetic precision.

## Query Types

Below is the list of query types currently supported in Financial Data Feeds. Each query type comes with its unique _keyword_ to use as the first part of query keys.

### Asset Spot Price - `SPOTPX`

This query returns the _current_ fair price of the given asset. Different providers may have different interpretation of what a fair price is (mid price between spread, last traded price, etc).

- **parameter**: For currency pairs, the parameter is two currency symbols separated by `-` (e.g. `ETH-USD` for `ETH` price in terms of `USD`). For other assets, the parameter is the asset symbol (e.g. `FB` for Facebook price in terms of its quote currency, `USD`).

- **output**: The final result of this dataset is the _median_ value across all data providers. The final result is multiplied by 10<sup>18</sup>.

## Asset Symbols

Financial dataset split asset symbols into several _asset classes_. Each asset class has its own method to name ticker symbols. Note that some query types only support certain asset classes.
