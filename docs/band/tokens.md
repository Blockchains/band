# Band Token and Dataset Tokens

Band Protocol is a multi-token system. The protocol consists of one native _Band token_ and multiple independent _Dataset tokens_. Tokens inside Band Protocol are [ERC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20) compatible, and are designed to work together to ensure the security of data curated on Band network.

## Band Token (BAND)

The Band Protocol token (BAND) is the native token of Band Protocol. It represents the collective stake across all datasets curated on top of of the protocol. BAND token is available for free from BAND crypto faucets. BAND is primarily used as collatoral to mint dataset tokens via continuous bonding curve mechanic.

Band Protocol is built around its own native token, Band token (BAND). The token provides four main utilities to the protocol ecosystem.

## Dataset Tokens

Each dataset inside Band Protocol is governed by its own unique dataset token. A dataset token is issued via

### Can't We Just Have One Token?

In theory, yes, we can. However, while having one token may look tempting at first glance, since it simplifies the protocol and combine the market cap of all datasets into one, doing that leads to two

- **Token holders have direct incentives to curate good data.** As the token’s value is tied directly to the specific dataset governed within this group, curating good data gives benefits solely to the token holders. Otherwise, if there is only one token, it is not clear how contributing to any specific dataset will lead to a significant value increase - and therefore the model for security and reliability of the data is weaker. This can easily lead to Tragedy of the Commons and low vote turnouts.

- **Bribing token holders becomes more difficult.** Conversely, if there is one token, one bad dataset will likely not result in a significant drop in token value. Thus, bribing token holders to manipulate a dataset is more probable than onetoken-one-dataset situation, where token holders’ loses are more significant should the dataset’s quality drops.
