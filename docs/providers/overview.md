# Data Provider Overview

As a data provider, your job is to provide real-world data to Band Protocol. To become a data provider, you need to stake dataset tokens to apply for a slot. Top data providers by the total number of staked dataset tokens from token holders are entitled to perform work. A portion of revenue collected from data queries are distributed evenly to active data providers, while the remaining is distributed to stakers.

Once entitled as a data provider, you are reponsible to maintain an instance of [Provider Node](https://github.com/bandprotocol/band/tree/master/go) ready to supply information to the blockchain. In this tutorial, we will walk through how you can setup the node and start serving data to Band Protocol. [ðŸ‘‰](/providers/architecture.md)
