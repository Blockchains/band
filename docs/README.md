[Band Protocol](https://bandprotocol.com) is a protocol for decentralized data governance on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol incentivizes multiple independent parties to work cooperatively to provide trusted data. Curated information is available on-chain, ready to be consumed by other blockchain protocols or decentralized applications. **Band Protocol serves as the data layer of the [Web3](http://wiki.web3.foundation/en/latest/tech_stack/tech_stack_overview/) ecosystem, bridging real world and/or subjective information to smart contracts.**
