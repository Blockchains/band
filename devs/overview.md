# Developer Overview

As a developer, you can utilize Band Protocol's public dataset to power your decentralized applications. In this section, we dive into the details of how you can connect your smart contracts with Band Protocol's query interface and start querying for external data, such as financial data points or sport results, on-chain using as a simple function call. Developers can start developing with Band Protocol right now on [Kovan testnet](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/) network. Ethereum mainnet launch is coming soon!

## Flow of Data

As explained in [Protocol Architecture](/band/overview.md),
